### Abstract

In this research project our team tried to solve the problem of hidden shapes (i.e.  complete a figure that has an invisible part). Some completely different approaches were used (Methods of Artificial Intelligence,
Mathematical Modelling, Human solutions) to compare results and understand what method is more suitable for this kind of problems.   After some experiments we observed that the results obtained with the
Artificial Intelligence approach were more human-likely and could be compared with decisions of real persons.  However, Mathematical modeling and Artificial Intelligence approaches adjust simple geometrical
shapes acceptably. Both methods can be developed for reconstruction of shapes which reflect objects of real world.  In that situation, our investigations would move from the sphere of analysis of geometrical shapes
to the vast world of object recognition

In this reposititory there are examples of code on R and Python, which solve the problem using Neural Networks, Random Forest and Bezier Curve.
